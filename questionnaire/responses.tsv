Timestamp	What company do you work for?	Have you ever built either an API with Hypermedia support or a Semantic Web / Linked Data-compatible API?	While building a Hypermedia API and/or Semantic Web/Linked-Data-compatible API, what kind of technologies were you looking for?	How much time did you spend finding the technologies to use?	Was this time constrained or free?	How did you find these technologies?	How difficult was it?	What were the two most difficult things?	Approximately, how many media types did you consider ?	What key features of media types were you looking for ?	Did you find one media type that had all the key features you selected?	What features the media types you choose was missing, forcing you to implement them by yourself?	Approximately, how many interface description languages did you consider ?	What key features of interface description languages were you looking for ?	Did you find one interface description language that had all the key features you selected?	What features the interface description language you choose was missing, forcing you to implement them by yourself?	Approximately, how many implementation frameworks did you consider ?	What key features of implementation frameworks were you looking for ?	Did you find one framework that had all the key features you selected?	What features the implementation framework you choose was missing, forcing you to implement them by yourself?	After using them for a few months, how much do these technologies end up meeting your needs ?	Do you have something else to tell us about this subject?	Why you have never built hypermedia APIs ?	Why you have never built Semantic Web / Linked Data APIs ?

Spring HATEOAS has a good DSL and semantic but the implementation and format are linked in the way you implement the resources... there is no abstraction above the format we choose sadly...

But the rest (using responses links instead of a custom reverse-proxy, using schema's definition to build page and forms) seems really complex to use (how to make a generated form look good?) so I think for now it costs more than it saves.
