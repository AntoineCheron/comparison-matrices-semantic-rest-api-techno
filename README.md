# A guiding Comparison Matrix of Semantic Restful Web APIs enabling Technologies - Methodology

The methodology used to obtain the classification matrix and criteria presented in *A guiding Comparison Matrix of Semantic Restful Web APIs enabling Technologies*.

## Methodology description

The design of the comparison matrix follows a 5 steps sequential process:

1. Looking for candidate technologies
2. Selecting candidate technology
3. Deep reading and understanding of each candidate technology
4. Elaboration of fine grain criteria to characterized and differentiate technologies
5. Verification that the elaborated criteria suited all technologies and the need from XXX developers
6. Verification that the elaborated criteria highlighted the differences between technologies

The research of candidate technology (step 1) was done through the following steps:

  1. Identification of the technologies to document APIs. Methods: (i) searching Google and Google Scholar for "service description", "web service description", "web API description", "semantic web service description", "interface description language", "restful service description", "rest API documentation", "rest modeling", "web service modeling" (ii) searching for tools automating tasks from services description, using keywords: "matchmakers", "service composition", "service discovery", "rest service analysis" and (iii) reading the thesis [Third Generation Web APIs](http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/research/third-generation-web-apis-bridging-the-gap-between-rest-and-linked-data.pdf) and [Description languages for REST APIs-state of the art, comparison, and transformation](https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/bitstream/11682/9622/1/MasterThesis_AntonScherer.pdf).
  2. Identification of the technologies to exchange textual documents representing data across distributed systems. Method: (i) searching Google and Google Scholar for: "hypermedia document", "hypermedia format", "RDF format", "RDF document", "data-interchange format", "hypermedia media-type", "semantic web media-type".
  3. Identification of the technologies to implement web APIs. Method: searching Google and Google Scholar for "hateoas framework", "hypermedia framework", "semantic restful framework", "semantic web framework", "linked data framework", "rest API framework", "restful service framework".
  4. Identification of tools to ease the selection of a features set for Web APIs. Method: searching Google and Google Scholar for "rest api best practices", "richardson maturity model", "semantic rest maturity model", "hypermedia api maturity model", "web api best practices", "web api/services categorization".
  5. Selecting papers related to building and evaluating Web APIs from the proceedings of the International Conference on Web Engineering and WS-REST.

From these researches, we selected papers (step 2), articles and web pages that were either the description of a technology, a comparison of technologies or a tool leveraging these technologies. We opened our research to technologies from the 1990s to today. 
From the selected papers and articles, we listed the IDLs, data-interchange formats and frameworks still available to use today.
Then, we read the specification of each chosen technology (step 3) and elaborate classification criteria (step 4).

We then verified (step 5) that the classification criteria suited the needs we had on previous projects we made at XXX for large companies.

As a final step (step 6), we read the specifications again to validate that the selected criteria highlighted differences and commonalities well, and to verify results.

All criteria are listed in [this table](./tables/criteria.png). Only machine-processable descriptions are considered.
